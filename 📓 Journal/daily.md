I completed chapter 13 of the rust book, which wasn't too difficult. I made some improvements to the minigrep project so that it may make good use of iterators. Finally, I started reading Ben Edgington's book Upgrading Ethereum and wrote a summary of the chapters on preliminaries. I'm finding that this study method of doing a first pass, taking some notes and writing things now at a later time in my summary journal to be an efficient study method.

With the eth2book, I found I enjoyed the discussion regarding safety and liveness and how various concepts related to it such as Casper FFG, LMD GHOST, protocols like PBFT and Tendermint.

Today I completed chapter 12 of the Rust book and the same time I completed the minigrep project. This was a good revision of the content of previous lessons including lifetimes, code organization and struct implementations.
