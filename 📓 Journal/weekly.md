# Weekly Journal

## Week of February 9th 2026
TLDR: 🦀 Rust week marathon

The week was fully focused on the Rust book, accompanying exercises and the Rustlings exercises, which I'm going through in parallel with the book.

I've managed to go up to chapter 8 of the Rust book and I am half-way through the exercises for that chapter.
I've been on a really good pace, though the chapter on the borrow checker required a bit more focus. I feel like this is something I will have to keep on practice by "fighting" the borrow checker as I later work on projects.
